## Download Logs

- The application creates a log file named `download_log.csv` in the root directory.
- This log file contains details of each download, including:
  - Row ID
  - MP3 URL
  - Download status (Success or Failed)

## Troubleshooting

1. **Error: `tkinter` not installed**:
   - Install `tkinter` using your package manager:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # For Ubuntu/Debian
     ```
     On macOS, ensure you have the latest `tcl-tk` installed:
     ```bash
     brew install tcl-tk
     ```

2. **Excel file not loading**:
   - Ensure the file is in `.xls` or `.xlsx` format.
   - Verify that it contains the required columns (`ŸÅÿß€åŸÑ` and `⁄©ÿØ ŸÖŸÑ€å`).

3. **Segmentation Fault or Freezing UI**:
   - Ensure you are running Python 3.7+ and have the correct dependencies installed.
   - Avoid large Excel files with thousands of rows; split them into smaller files.
